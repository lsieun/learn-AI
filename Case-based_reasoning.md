# Case-based reasoning #

**Case-based reasoning** (**CBR**)  is the process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems.

It has been argued that case-based reasoning is not only **a powerful method for computer reasoning**, but also **a pervasive behavior in everyday human problem solving**; or, more radically, that all reasoning is based on past cases personally experienced.
